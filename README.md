# Volcano-Speciation
This program calculates the speciation of gases produced by volcano by solving gas-melt and gas-gas equilibrium. The model is explained in the Jupyter notebook file titled "Explanation_of_model," and also in "methods_github.pdf". Note that "methods_github.pdf" is a rough draft, yet it should still be understandable.

"functions.py" contains the master function "solve_gases" which calculates gas-melt and gas-gas equilibrium.

This all is for a paper I am currently working on. I will be updating this Github page as I finish up the paper.
