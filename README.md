# Volcano-Speciation
This program calculates the speciation of gases produced by volcano by solving gas-melt and gas-gas equilibrium. This model is explained in the Jupyter notebook file titled "Explanation_of_model." The file functions.py contains the "solve_gases" function which will solve for the speciation of gases given several inputs.

The file "Monte_carlo_simulations" contains calculations made for a paper I am currently working on. It will probably change soon.
